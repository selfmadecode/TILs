## Is it possible to divide by 0 ?
### YES!

In standard mathematics, division by zero is undefined, but there *are* some *non-standard branches or extensions of mathematics* where people have found ways to work with division by zero. 

### Standard Mathematics: Division by Zero Is *Undefined*

In arithmetic and algebra:

* Expressions like 1 / 0 or x / 0 are undefined.
* This is because no number multiplied by 0 can produce a nonzero number.


### Non-Standard Approaches

#### Projective Geometry

* In the *projective extended real line*, mathematicians add a "point at infinity."
* Division by zero isn't directly defined, but you can approach ideas like:

  * 1 / 0 → ∞, and 1 / ∞ → 0
* However, it's *not arithmetic* as usual; it's more about limits and topology.

#### 2. *Riemann Sphere (Complex Analysis)*

* The complex plane is extended by adding a point at infinity.
* In this setting:

  * 1 / 0 = ∞, and 1 / ∞ = 0
* But: 0 / 0 is still undefined.


So yes, *there are branches* of math where division by zero is possible but not within traditional arithmetic or algebra.
